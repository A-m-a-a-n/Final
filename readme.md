# pass

As of 9/10/2021, UC Berkeley requires students to fill out a daily screener through their app to access dinning halls / RSF / etc. The app is slow, buggy, and requires you to sign-in + authenticate with duo mobile every single time. On top of that, the survey itself is pointless -- it asks "_hey, do you have COVID symptoms? do you have the vax?_" and a few other pointless questions no one reads anyways. 

This site should save you some time by skipping the app. It shows the exact same html/css from the app (yoink'd by using `brave://inspect/#devices` see the webview of the app). After you enter your full name, tap anywhere on the pass page and you'll enter full screen (hiding the browser GUI).
